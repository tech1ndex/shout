### SHOUT

A simple Python project to play a sound byte every time the Bills score.

### USAGE

In order to get this working you just need to provide a sound file in any format that vlc will support and update `victory_sound_path` in the Settings instance accordingly. 

This can also be re-purposed for other teams simply by updating the `team_name` field in the Settings instance.
